The system supports various billing structures, including annual and monthly dues, and optional add-on services. The backend is built using Nest.js and PostgreSQL, and it includes a comprehensive RESTful API, email functionality using Gmail SMTP, and a cron job to send reminders for upcoming membership fees.

## Cron Job

A cron job is implemented to run daily and check for upcoming membership fees. It differentiates between annual memberships and add-on services, considering the IsFirstMonth flag.

- For new members (first month):
- Calculate the reminder date (e.g., 7 days before the due date) based on the annual membership due date.
- Send an email reminder with the membership type, total amount for the combined annual fee and first month's add-on service charges, and a link to the full invoice.
- For existing members (subsequent months):
- Check if the current date falls within the month for which the add-on service applies.
- Send an email reminder with the service name, monthly amount, and a link to the invoice for that specific month's add-on service charge.

## Email Functionality

The system uses Gmail SMTP to send email reminders. The email content includes:

- Subject: Fitness+ Membership Reminder - \[Membership Type\]
- Body: A message reminding the member about the upcoming payment, including the membership details (type, due date for annual or month for add-on services), and a link to the relevant invoice.

## Testing
